3. 
    Code Readability: 5
        The code is clearly organized into functions with logical flow and consistent 
        formatting.
    Correctness: 5
        The implementation correctly performs Vigenère encryption and decryption.
    Written or oral explanation and efficiency: 5
        The algorithm operates in linear time relative to input size and uses modular 
        arithmetic effectively.
4. 
    Code Readability: 5
        The code is neatly structured with clear function separation, descriptive names, 
        and helpful comments that make it easy to follow the logic.
    Correctness: 5
        The implementation correctly computes the Index of Coincidence and generates the 
        most likely Vigenère keyword with accurate statistical methods.
    Written or oral explanation and efficiency: 5
        The program efficiently processes text using linear-time loops, leverages modular 
        arithmetic, and avoids unnecessary recomputation, ensuring smooth performance 
        even with longer inputs.
